## 3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry

### 3.3.1 Docker Introduction

Docker, an open-source platform and tool, helps you to package, distribute, and run apps within containers. Container is a lightweight, independent, executable software package that includes the application code, runtime environment, system tools, system libraries and settings. Docker allows developers to package applications along with their dependencies, not just the application itself, facilitating rapid and consistent deployment across different environments. 
In technical terms, Docker utilizes Linux containerization technology of operating system, making the isolation between applications more efficient. And it can run multiple containers on the same physical machine, with each container being independent and not affecting each other.
After all, Docker can be understood as a tool that makes applications and their dependencies more portable and easier to manage, bringing great convenience to software development and deployment.

### 3.3.2 Docker General Commands

All the games and programs of this product will be run in the Docker container. In order to help users to quickly understand and get started with this product, the following introduces the general commands of Docker. 

(1) Start up the device and connect it with VNC remote connection tool according to "[**3.1 VNC Installation and Connection**](#anchor_3_1)".

(2)  Click the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image3.png" style="width:0.32292in;height:0.30208in" /> on the left top corner of the system desktop to open Terminator terminal. 

<p id="anchor_3_3_2_1"></p>

* **Check Containers**

Command parameters instructionï¼š`docker ps [OPTIONS]`

General parameters instruction:

(1) -a ï¼šlist all currently running containers + containers that have been run in the past.

(2) -l ï¼šdisplay recently created containers

(3) -n=? ï¼šdisplay recently created n containers

(4) -q ï¼šsilent mode, only display container number

In the command line terminal, enter "**docker ps -a**" to display running and previously run containers. "**container id**" is the ID of containers, "**image**" is the image name of this container, "**created**" is the created time of the container, "**status**" is current state of container.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image5.png"  />

* **Enter Containers**

According to "[**3.3.2 Docker General Commands -> Check Containers**](#anchor_3_3_2_1)" to get container ID (the only one). Input command "**docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu 82df /bin/bash**" to enter the container where the functional program is installed. The container ID can be abbreviated as long as it is the unique identification of this container.

```bash
docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu 82df /bin/bash
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image6.png"  />

* **Exit Containers**

There are two commands to exit containers:

(1) Input "**exit**" directly in terminal and press enter key. While the container will stop running and exit.

```bash
exit
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image7.png"  />

(2)  Use the shortcut key combination **"ctrl+P+Q"**. The container will exit directly but remain running. You can input command "**docker ps**" in terminal to check the running containers. 

```bash
docker ps
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image8.png"  />

### 3.3.3 Convenient Tool Usage (MUST READ)

It is inconvenient to input command in the terminator terminal every time. Therefore, you can set command to enter the container in the terminator tool. 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image9.png"  />

(1)  Right-click the terminator window, and click "**Preference**".

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image10.png"  />

(2) Select **"Profiles->Command"**.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image11.png"  />

(3)  In the  column, input command **"xhost + && docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu puppypi /bin/zsh"** to enter the container. 

:::{Note}

82df is the container ID of the container with the functional games.

:::

```bash
xhost + && docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu puppypi /bin/zsh
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/image12.png"  />

(4)  Then click to close. In this way, every time you open the terminal, you can enter directly to the container with the functional program.

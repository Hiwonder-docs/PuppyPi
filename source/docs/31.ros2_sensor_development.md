### 24.1.3 Glowy Ultrasonic Sensor Introduction

The ultrasonic ranging chip integrates ultrasonic transmitting circuit, receiving circuit, digital processing circuit, etc. This module adopts IIC communication interface through which the measured distance can be read.

Besides, on each probe, there is RGB light whose brightness can be adjusted and parameters of color channel can be modified to change the color.

### 24.1.4 Program Logic

Firstly, set the distance range. Then control RGB colored light to light on or get out though the change of the level. Lastly, control the color of light through changing the parameter of color channels.

The source code of this program is stored in **[ros2_ws/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor/sonar_avoidance.py](../_static/source_code/ros2/sonar_avoidance.zip)**

```python
    def sonar_callback(self):
        distance = self.s.getDistance() # 获得检测的距离(obtain detected distance)
        print(f'distance: {distance}(mm)')
        
        if distance <= 300:
            if not self.forward:
                self.forward = True
                self.s.setRGB(1, (255, 0, 0)) # 设为红色(set to red color)
                self.s.setRGB(0, (255, 0, 0))
                # 设置 RGB 灯颜色 (set RGB light color)
                self.velocity_publisher.publish(Velocity(x=5.0, y=0.0, yaw_rate=0.3))
                self.get_logger().info('Turning left')               
        else:
            if self.forward:
                self.forward = False
                # 设置 RGB 灯颜色 (set RGB light color)
                self.s.setRGB(1, (0, 0, 255)) # 设为蓝色(set to blue)
                self.s.setRGB(0, (0, 0, 255))
                self.velocity_publisher.publish(Velocity(x=15.0, y=0.0, yaw_rate=0.0))

### 24.4.3 Dot Matrix Display Introduction

Dot matrix display module composed of two 8x8 LED dot matrix screens, which can be controlled through driving the control chip. It features high brightness, no-flicker display, convenient wiring, etc. And it can display various content, including number, text, pattern, etc.

### 24.4.4 Program Logic

In this program, a set of hexadecimal data is used to control the dot matrix screen to display the content. A set of hexadecimal data consists of 16 data each of which controls a column of LED.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_31/section_4/1.2/media/image3.png" style="width:400px" alt="" />

It is simple to set the data. For example, control the dot matrix display to display "**Hello**".

```py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # 显示'Hello'(display 'Hello')
    while True:
        try:
            dms.display_buf=(0x7f, 0x08, 0x7f, 0x00, 0x7c, 0x54, 0x5c, 0x00,
                              0x7c, 0x40, 0x00,0x7c, 0x40, 0x38, 0x44, 0x38)
            dms.update_display()
            time.sleep(5)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            dms.display_buf = [0]*16
            dms.update_display()
            break
```

The parameter in brackets of 32<sup>nd</sup> and 33<sup>rd</sup> line are the array for setting the displayed pattern. The converted binary number of its first element "**0x7f**" is 01111111 which represents the light status, that is off on on on on on on on.

As the same, the rest 15 elements are also for controlling the LED lights to display "**Hello**".

:::{Note}

You can find "Instructions for Using the Font Software" in the same directory of this section, where you can quickly obtain control arrays using the font software.

:::

### 24.5.3 Module Usage

Using I2C communication, the user only needs to transmit the recognized keywords into the chip in the form of a string. This will take effect immediately in the next recognition.

The module has three usage modes. Users can set two different usage modes through programming.

Button Detection Mode: When the system's main control MCU receives an external trigger (such as the user pressing a button), it will start a timed recognition process on the chip (e.g., 5 seconds). During this timed process, the user needs to speak the voice keywords to be recognized. After this process ends, the user needs to trigger it again to start a new recognition process.

Loop Detection Mode: The system's main control MCU repeatedly starts the recognition process. If no one speaks and there is no recognition result, a new recognition process will start after each timed recognition process ends. If there is a recognition result, the system will perform the corresponding action based on the recognition (e.g., play a sound as a response) and then start a new recognition process.

Password Detection Mode: The password mode requires a keyword to wake up the system. After waking up, the system can perform recognition. The default wake-up keyword is the first phrase. After the recognition ends, to perform recognition again, it needs to be woken up again.

### 24.5.4 Program Logic

The source code of this program is stored in the Docker container: [ros2_ws/src/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor/asr_detect_demo](../_static/source_code/ros2/asr_detect_demo.zip)

By using the asr.setMode function, you can set the recognition mode. In the code line asr.setMode(2), the parameter 2 means the command mode. You can then add entries using the asr.addWords function. For example, in the code asr.addWords(1, 'kai shi'), the parameter 1 is the index of the entry, and the parameter kai shi is the pinyin for the entry "开始" (which means "**start**").

Firstly, create a new folder named "**MP3**", and then put the songs into this folder. The name format is "**0001+ name of the song**". For example, we can name "**A Little Apple**" **0001 A Little Apple**. Or we can directly name it **four numbers**, like 0001. Similarly, repeat for others such as 0010, 0100, 1000, and so on.

The source code of this program is stored in the Docker container:

**[ros2_ws/src/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor/mp3_moonwalk_demo.py](../_static/source_code/ros2/mp3_moonwalk_demo.zip)**

### 24.7.5 Operation Steps

(1) Turn on PuppyPi and connect it to Raspberry Pi via VNC.

(2) Click <img src="../_static/media\chapter_31\section_7\1.2\media\image4.png" style="width:0.42917in;height:0.47361in" />at upper left corner to initiate the Terminator ROS2 terminal.

(3) Enter the following command and press Enter to run the game program.

```bash
cd ros2_ws/src/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor
```

```bash
python3 mp3_moonwalk_demo.py
```

(4) If need to close this program, we can press "**Ctrl+C**". If it fails to close, please try again.

### 24.7.6 Program Outcome

After the program starts, MP3 module will play the music in SD card and PuppyPi will dance.

### 24.7.7 Function Extension

If you need to change the song, please follow the below steps to operate. Take replacing the original song with "**0007**" song for example.

:::{Note}

we need to download the substitute to the SD card of MP3 module, and name it four numbers, such as 0007.

(2) Input the following command and press Enter to open program file.

```bash
vim ros2_ws/src/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor/mp3.moonwalk_demo.py
```

(3) Then find the codes in red frame. And press "**i**" key to enter editing mode.

```bash
self.mp3.playNum(25)
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media\chapter_31\section_7\1.2\media\image8.png"  />

(4) The parameter in parenthesis of playNum function is the number of the song. And we modify the parameter as 7. After modification, press "**Esc**", input "**:wq**" and press Enter to save the modified content.

```py
self.mp3.playNum(7) #播放歌曲7(play song number 7)
```

```bash
:wq
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media\chapter_31\section_7\1.2\media\image9.png"  />

:::{Note}
when inputting the number of song, we can omit "**000**" and directly input "**7**".

### 24.8.2 Getting Ready

Prepare a voice recognition sensor and connect it to I2C interface on Raspberry Pi expansion board with 4PIN wire as the picture shown.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_31/section_8/1.2/media/image2.png"  style="width:600px;" alt="puppypi" />

:::{Note}

4PIN wire adopts anti-reverse plug in design, please don't insert violently.

### 24.8.3 Module Usage

Using I2C communication, the user only needs to transmit the recognized keywords into the chip in the form of a string. This will take effect immediately in the next recognition.

The module has three usage modes. Users can set two different usage modes through programming.

Button Detection Mode: When the system's main control MCU receives an external trigger (such as the user pressing a button), it will start a timed recognition process on the chip (e.g., 5 seconds). During this timed process, the user needs to speak the voice keywords to be recognized. After this process ends, the user needs to trigger it again to start a new recognition process.

Loop Detection Mode: The system's main control MCU repeatedly starts the recognition process. If no one speaks and there is no recognition result, a new recognition process will start after each timed recognition process ends. If there is a recognition result, the system will perform the corresponding action based on the recognition (e.g., play a sound as a response) and then start a new recognition process.

Password Detection Mode: The password mode requires a keyword to wake up the system. After waking up, the system can perform recognition. The default wake-up keyword is the first phrase. After the recognition ends, to perform recognition again, it needs to be woken up again.

### 24.8.4 Working Principle

The source code of this program is stored in the Docker container:

**[ros2_ws/src/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor/voice_interaction_demo.py](../_static/source_code/ros2/voice_interaction_demo.zip)**

By using the asr.setMode function, you can set the recognition mode. In the code line asr.setMode(2), the parameter 2 means the command mode. You can then add entries using the asr.addWords function. For example, in the code asr.addWords(1, 'kai shi'), the parameter 1 is the index of the entry, and the parameter kai shi is the pinyin for the entry "开始" (which means "**start**").

### 24.8.5 Operation Steps

(1) Turn on PuppyPi, and connect it to Raspberry Pi desktop via VNC.

(2) Click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_31/section_8/1.2/media/image4.png" style="width:0.39236in;height:0.43333in" /> at upper left corner to enter Terminator ROS2 terminal.

(3) Enter the following commands and press Enter to run the program. (The commands consist of two lines; input and execute one line at a time.)

```bash
cd ros2_ws/src/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor
```

```bash
python3 voice_interaction_demo.py
```

(4) If need to close this program, we can press "**Ctrl+C**". If it fails to close, please try again.

### 24.8.6 Program Outcome

After the program starts running, the robotic dog will remain standing. Upon saying "**start**" and recognizing it, the system will then say "**lift head**". Following this command, the robotic dog will perform the action of lifting its head. Subsequently, saying "**lie down**" will prompt the robotic dog to switch to a lying down position. Saying "**stand at attention**" will cause the robotic dog to return to a standing position. Finally, saying "**march in place**" will initiate the robotic dog to start marching in place.
